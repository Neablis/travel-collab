# Contracts changelog

Every change to `packages/contracts` (commands, events, DTOs, Conflict types)
gets an entry here, in the same PR as the change and all consumer updates.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- What changed (schema names)
- Why
- Consumers updated (packages/apps touched)
- Breaking? yes/no — if yes, migration notes
```

## 2026-07-08 — M1 planning-core schemas
- Added: commands `AddDay`, `RemoveDay`, `SetTripStartDate`, `AddActivity`,
  `UpdateActivity`, `MoveActivity`, `RemoveActivity`; command union `TripCommand`
- Added: events `DayAddedV1`, `DayRemovedV1`, `TripStartDateSetV1`,
  `ActivityAddedV1`, `ActivityUpdatedV1`, `ActivityMovedV1`, `ActivityRemovedV1`;
  `TripEvent` grew from a single schema into a discriminated union
- Added: value objects `TimeWindow`, `Location`; DTOs `ActivityView`, `TripDetail`
- Why: M1 planning core — days, backlog, activities, board moves, conflicts read model
- Consumers updated: `@tc/domain` (decide/evolve/projections), `apps/web` (pipeline, routes, UI) — in this same PR
- Breaking? no — `TripEvent.parse` accepts all previously stored events unchanged

## 2026-07-08 — backfill: M0 initial schemas (created 2026-07-07)
- Added (in M0): `CreateTrip`, `TripCreatedV1`, `TripEvent`, `TripMember`,
  `TripSummary`, `EventEnvelope`, `Conflict`
- Why: recorded retroactively — M0 created the package without a changelog entry
- Consumers: `@tc/domain`, `apps/web`
- Breaking? no
