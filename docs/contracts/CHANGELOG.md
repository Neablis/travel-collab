# Contracts changelog

Every change to `packages/contracts` (commands, events, DTOs, Conflict types)
gets an entry here, in the same PR as the change and all consumer updates.

Format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- What changed (schema names)
- Why
- Consumers updated (packages/apps touched)
- Breaking? yes/no — if yes, migration notes
```

## 2026-07-19 — M6 command endpoints return authoritative state
- Changed: `POST /api/trips/:id/commands` success response now includes
  `{ detail: TripDetail, history: TripHistory }` (was `{ ok, tripId }`)
- Added: `POST /api/trips/:id/commands/batch` with body `{ commands: BatchableCommand[] }`,
  same response shape
- Why: M6 optimistic updates reconcile from the response instead of refetching
- Consumers updated: apps/web apiClient + TripProvider
- Breaking? no — response fields added; new endpoint is additive

## 2026-07-19 — M6 atomic changes + optimistic updates
- Added: `BatchableCommand` (discriminated union — TripCommand minus CreateTrip
  and the history commands) for the batch endpoint
- Why: M6 — submit a series of commands as one atomic batch (one history entry)
- Consumers updated: packages/domain (predict), apps/web (batch route, apiClient)
- Breaking? no — additive

## 2026-07-10 — M4 money & lenses schemas
- Added: `Money` (integer minor units + ISO-4217 currency)
- Added: `cost` on `AddActivity` (optional) / `UpdateActivity` (nullable, optional)
  and on `ActivityAddedV1`/`ActivityUpdatedV1` payloads (`Money.nullable().default(null)`)
- Added: commands `SetTripCurrency`, `SetTripBudget`; events `TripCurrencySetV1`,
  `TripBudgetSetV1` (joined `TripCommand`/`TripEvent`)
- Added: `ActivityView.cost`; `TripDetail.currency`, `.budget`, `.tripCostTotal`,
  `.unscheduledCostSubtotal`, `.budgetRemaining`, `days[].costSubtotal`
- Why: M4 — costs on activities, derived cost rollups, trip currency & budget,
  over-budget conflict (ADR-008, ADR-009)
- Consumers updated: `@tc/domain` (state/evolve/equality/diff/decide/costs/
  conflicts/detail), `apps/web` (projection wiring, mocks, money editors, lenses)
  — same PR
- Breaking? no — event payload additions default (`cost` → null), so
  `TripEvent.parse` accepts all previously stored events unchanged; DTO additions
  are new required fields produced only by the updated projection

## 2026-07-09 — M3 place & time schemas
- Added: `Weekday`, `Anchor` (union: dayOfWeek | dateRange | timeOfDay | publicHoliday)
- Added: `anchors` on `AddActivity`/`UpdateActivity` (optional) and on
  `ActivityAddedV1`/`ActivityUpdatedV1` payloads (`z.array(Anchor).default([])`)
- Added: `Location.countryCode` (optional, ISO-3166 alpha-2)
- Added: `ActivityView.anchors`; `TripDetail.days[].date` (nullable derived date)
- Why: M3 — date-anchored activities, derived day dates, geocoded locations
- Consumers updated: `@tc/domain` (state/evolve/decide/diff/equality/conflicts/
  detail), `apps/web` (projection wiring, mocks, lens UI) — same PR
- Breaking? no — event payload additions default, so `TripEvent.parse` accepts
  all previously stored events unchanged; DTO additions are new required fields
  produced only by the updated projection

## 2026-07-08 — M2 history & time travel schemas
- Added: `Origin`; `EventEnvelope` gains required `batchId` + `origin`
- Added: commands `UndoLastChange`, `RedoChange`, `RevertToState`,
  `DismissConflict` (joined `TripCommand`)
- Added: events `ConflictDismissedV1`, `ConflictUndismissedV1` (joined `TripEvent`)
- Added: DTOs `HistoryEntry`, `TripHistory`; `TripDetail` gains `dismissedConflictIds`
- Why: M2 — undo/redo/revert via compensating events (ADR-005), history UI,
  persistent conflict dismissal
- Consumers updated: `@tc/domain`, `apps/web` (pipeline, event store + column
  migration with backfill, routes, UI) — in this same PR
- Breaking? yes, envelope only — stored events need the Task 5 backfill
  migration (batch_id = own uuid, origin = user); event payloads unchanged,
  `TripEvent.parse` accepts all previously stored events

## 2026-07-08 — M1 planning-core schemas
- Added: commands `AddDay`, `RemoveDay`, `SetTripStartDate`, `AddActivity`,
  `UpdateActivity`, `MoveActivity`, `RemoveActivity`; command union `TripCommand`
- Added: events `DayAddedV1`, `DayRemovedV1`, `TripStartDateSetV1`,
  `ActivityAddedV1`, `ActivityUpdatedV1`, `ActivityMovedV1`, `ActivityRemovedV1`;
  `TripEvent` grew from a single schema into a discriminated union
- Added: value objects `TimeWindow`, `Location`; DTOs `ActivityView`, `TripDetail`
- Why: M1 planning core — days, backlog, activities, board moves, conflicts read model
- Consumers updated: `@tc/domain` (decide/evolve/projections), `apps/web` (pipeline, routes, UI) — in this same PR
- Breaking? no — `TripEvent.parse` accepts all previously stored events unchanged

## 2026-07-08 — backfill: M0 initial schemas (created 2026-07-07)
- Added (in M0): `CreateTrip`, `TripCreatedV1`, `TripEvent`, `TripMember`,
  `TripSummary`, `EventEnvelope`, `Conflict`
- Why: recorded retroactively — M0 created the package without a changelog entry
- Consumers: `@tc/domain`, `apps/web`
- Breaking? no
